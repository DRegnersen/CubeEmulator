<h1 align="left">Console app for solving a Rubik's cube</h1>
This project will help you with creating, modifying and solving tasks of a Rubik's cube without leaving a console. The program is able to solve the puzzle using an evolutionary algorithm, selecting the most successful states of the cube. The app allows you to record any changes of the cube by conveniently displaying a sweep on your screen. Saving to a file will help you to store the state of the cube for a further program launch.
